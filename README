Anonymous ftp setup:

*anonymous-ftp-acocunt* must exist in /etc/passwd and it's home
directory must exist.  The home directory should be set up for a
chroot environment.  Required files:

/dev/null (Linux: mknod null c 1 3; chmod a+w null)
/bin/ls Ideally statically linked.  If not, then the necessary shared
        libraries are necessary in /lib or /usr/lib

Optional:
/welcome.msg  Displayed after login
/etc/passwd and /etc/group if you want 'ls' to display names instead
  of numbers.
tar, compression programs, etc if you want conversions.
