*******************************************************************************
1. Installation

Allegro FTPd (aFTPd) runs on Linux and Solaris on Allegro Common
Lisp.

You can either build aFTPd from sources or use the binaries built by
Franz Inc.  If you want to build your own, then you must have Allegro
CL Enterprise Edition.

<<<<insert discussion of deployment w/Enterprise here>>>>

*******************************************************************************
1A. Installation: from source code

Download and unpack the source code.  Then, startup Allegro CL
Enterprise and type, in the directory containing the source code:

	   :cl ftpd.cl
	   (build)

This will make an `aftpd' directory with the program `aftpd' and
supporting files.  These files should be kept together if they are to
be installed in another directory.

*******************************************************************************
1B. Installation: using the supplied binaries

<<<<finish me>>>>

*******************************************************************************
2. Configuration

Allegro FTPd configuration is determined by the defparameter forms in
config.cl.  Most of the forms have comments which indicate their
proper use.  All of the parameters can be overridden at runtime by the
/etc/aftpd.cl file (or whichever pathname is specified in *configfile*
in ftpd.cl).  /etc/aftpd.cl is loaded when the FTP server is first
started, and every time a new connection is made.  Simply supply setq
forms in /etc/aftpd.cl to override default configuration variables.

Command line options:

-f file		Use alternate config file.
-d		Run in debug mode [doesn't fork]
-p portnum	Use alternate ftp server port

*******************************************************************************
2A. Configuration: anonymous FTP setup

*anonymous-ftp-account* must exist in /etc/passwd and it's home
directory must exist.  The home directory should be set up for a
chroot environment.  Required files (relative to the chroot'd home
directory)

/dev/null
    On Linux, create with ``mknod null c 1 3; chmod a+w null''.

/bin/ls
    Ideally (from a security standpoint) it should be statically
    linked.  If not, then the necessary shared libraries should exist
    in the anonymous ftp account home directory.

Optional:

/welcome.msg
    Displayed after authentication has been completed.

/etc/passwd
/etc/group
    If you want 'ls' to display user/group names instead of id
    numbers.

/bin/tar
/bin/zip
/bin/bzip2
/bin/gzip
/bin/compress
    If you want conversions, and don't forget their shared libraries.

No files/directories should be writeable except for those directories
in which you want to allow anonymous FTP uploads.

If the `ls' or `dir' commands from an FTP client show no files, and
you know there are files to list, check that `ls' runs while
chroot'd.  It may be that some shared library needed by `ls', if it is
dynamically linked, is not there.

*******************************************************************************
2B. Configuration: Firewall considerations

For passive FTP to work, the ports specified by *pasvrange* in
config.cl must be open on the firewall.  Additionally, ports given by
*ftpport* and *ftpdataport* should be open.

*******************************************************************************
2C. Configuration: Restricted users

Restricted users:

The restricted users feature allows you to confine users to their home
directory and below.  This feature is best for FTP-only users (i.e.,
users that have no other file access on the system beyond FTP).  If a
user has, for example, shell access to the system, they can make a
symbolic link in their home directory that will allow them to escape
this restriction.  The FTP protocol implemented in this version of the
Allegro FTPd doesn't allow for the creation of symbolic links, so
FTP-only accounts shouldn't (in the absence of bugs) be able to
escape.

If you want to allow a restricted user to reach other restricted
subsets of the filesystem, you can make symbolic links in their home
directory which point to other directories.  As long as those
directories and subdirectories don't have symbolic links which point
outside of them, the user will remain confined within them.

The restricted user feature works by keeping careful track of the
user's current working directory.  When a restricted user initially
logs in, their cwd (current working directory) is set to their home
directory (as stated in /etc/passwd).  All pathnames that a user
enters are parsed and converted into absolute pathnames.  When the
pathname parser encounters '..', it strips one component from the tail
of the pathname.  All absolute pathnames must have a prefix that is
equal to the restricted user's directory, otherwise access will be
denied.

The following example illustrates these concepts:

[User's home directory is /home/dancy]
login:  cwd starts at /home/dancy

cd ..:  disallowed because absolute pathname is /home

cd /:  disallowed because absolute pathname is /

cd ../../home/dancy:  allowed because absolute pathname is /home/dancy

cd somedir:  allowed because absolute pathname is /home/dancy/somedir.
[cwd is now /home/dancy/somedir]

cd ..:  allowed because absolute pathname is /home/dancy
[cwd is now /home/dancy]

[Assume that 'dirptr' is a symbolic link to /home/joe]
cd dirptr:  allowed because absolute pathname is /home/dancy/dirptr 
            even though the ultimate destination, as far as the
            operating system is concerned, is /home/joe.
[cwd is now /home/dancy/dirptr]

cd ..:  allowed because absolute pathname is /home/dancy again.

3. Security notes

Since this FTP server is written in Common Lisp, it should be free of
buffer overflows.  None of the foreign functions used fill in any
variable-sized buffers so things should be safe on that front as well.
One target of attack may be the conversions.  Bugs in conversion
programs could lead to security compromises.  For example, gzip-1.2.4
may suffer a buffer overflow if its command line is too long (see
http://www.securityfocus.com/advisories/3801 ).  Make sure all of your
conversion programs are up-to-date.  If you're really worried, you can
set *conversions* to 'nil' to disallow all conversions.  If you want
to audit the security of this FTP server, it is recommended that you
examine the make-full-path and glob functions (and their callers and
callees).
