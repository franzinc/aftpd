   contact Franz for an original copy.

2. LIMITATIONS ON LICENSE. The license granted in Section 1 is subject
   to the following restrictions:

   a. The Software is to be used only for non-commercial purposes
   unless you obtain Franz's prior written consent. Prohibited

   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
   herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance with this
   Agreement by recipients.
