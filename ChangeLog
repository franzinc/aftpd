2005-12-19  Kevin Layer  <layer@relay.known.net>

	* makefile: preferred lisp => 8.0; better install for SuSE

2005-10-11  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.0.28
	
	* ftpd.cl: Bumped version to 1.0.28 to indicate 8.0.beta build.

	* Makefile: Find the build lisp in the same way as maild.

	
2005-08-19  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* ftpd.cl: Bumped version to 1.0.27:

	When building passive socket or making an outgoing active
	connection, always use the interface the data connection is on.

2005-07-17  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* ftpd.cl: Version 1.0.26

	* ftpd.cl: Added support for SITE UTIME command.
	
2005-05-25  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* ftpd.cl: Bumped version number for new binary builds on ACL 7.0

	* ftpd.cl: Tweaked the error handling on a few filesystem calls.
	Now uses *strict-probe-file*.  

	* ftpd.cl: Fixed for building on FreeBSD 4.10.

	* makefile.cl: Use 7.0 lisp for building.  Added FreeBSD support.

	* rc.aftpd.sh: new for FreeBSD 4.

	* readme.txt: Updated to reflect FreeBSD support.
	
2004-07-13  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>
1.0.24
	* ftpd.cl: cmd-rnto: Added missing 'fullpath' to format string
	when complaining about out of bounds rename.

	* debug.cl: Deleted.  Cruft removal.

	* *.tgz: Updating source and binary tarballs.
	
2004-01-14  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>
<no version change>
	
	* makefile: Updated mlisp variable for use offsite.  Fixed install
	rule.
	
2004-01-14  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.0.23
	
	* ftpd.cl:

	spawn-client:  Close the client socket with :abort t

	ftpd-main: close and reopen logfiles for each connection to allow
	for better log rotation.  Also, when closing the control
	connection due to unexpected errors, don't try to report the error
	on the control connection.. since it's the control channel that
	probably caused the unexpected error in the first place.  Just log
	the error and close down.  

	main: removed obsolete "I" in call to
	with-command-line-arguments.  Commented out prior change of
	setting *print-hostname-in-stream* to nil.  I guess it made no
	difference.   Also, log the program version in the ftp log when
	starting up.

	makefile:  Updated regular expression for locating the version
	variable.
	
2002-12-19  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.0.22
	
	* ftpd.cl:  setf socket:*print-hostname-in-stream* to nil to see
	if hung process problem goes away.

	
2002-12-18  Kevin Layer  <layer@crikey>
<no version change, just doc changes>

	* config.cl: fix typos in comments
	* readme.txt: fix typo

2002-12-13  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.0.21
      * config.cl:  Added *default-directory-mode* parameter which is used
      for directories created by MKD.  Note that umask will affect final
      mode that is used.
	 
      * ftpd.cl: Updated the cleanup func to display a reason for the
      closeout.  

	cmd-mkd:  Pass the new *default-directory-mode* parameter to
	make-directory.  Also, if anonymous mkdir's are allowed, don't
	bother quarantining anonymous mkdirs.  That would just result in a
	bunch of emtpy directories being created that can't be accessed.
	
	
2002-12-12  Kevin Layer  <layer@crikey>
1.0.20

	* ftpd.cl:
	- cmd-stou does not exist (STOU is not implemented)
	- DNS: use only acldns and not C library
	- use umask for MKD
	- MDTM was returning the wrong time


	
*******************************************************************************
1.0.19 release
*******************************************************************************

2002-11-14  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.0.19
	
	* ftpd.cl: Added finish-output call in write-complete-vector so
	that calls to socket-bytes-written count will return proper
	information (when logging to the xferlog).
	* ftpd.cl: The open-logs function now uses :always-append when
	opening/creating the regular log and the xfer log.
	Moved the ftp-log function down closer to the xfer-log
	function.  
	Removed the with-stream-lock stuff around ftp-log and xfer-log
	since they are no longer needed now that the files are opened with
	:always-append.

	* ftpd.cl: Reworked NLST once more to handle all the edge cases.
	It should be pretty compatible w/ wu-ftpd now.
	
2002-11-12  Kevin Layer  <layer@crikey>
1.0.18

	* makefile: break on warnings when compiling
	* ftpd.cl: use osi module; remove all def-foreign-call's; don't
	use eol.cl, passwd.cl and posix-lock.cl in favor of equivalent
	functionality in osi module
	* (NEW) debug.cl: for debugging
	* (REMOVED) eol.cl: no longer needed
	* (REMOVED) passwd.cl: no longer needed
	* (REMOVED) posix-lock.cl: no longer needed
	* (REMOVED) system-constants.c: no longer needed

2002-10-22  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.0.17

	* Changed the code for NLST to make it behave more like wu-ftpd.
	
2002-09-30  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.0.16

	Call probe-pids-file during PASS cmd regardless of *maxusers*
	variable.  This will keep the size of the file in check.

	Now open-logs in main function, before forking.  

	Uses with-fork macro in main now.

	Logs a message "FTP server started" now.

	disassociate function has been changed quite a bit.  Instead of
	making stdin, stdout, and stderr all use /dev/null, just stdin
	uses /dev/null.  stdout and stderr now use *logstream*'s file
	descriptor.  This will allow for catching any diagnostic messages
	that would have otherwise been dropped (like if the server socket
	port is already in use by another ftp process).  

	makefile:  added build.tmp to the clean rule.
	
2002-09-23  Kevin Layer  <layer@crikey>
1.0.15

	* eol.cl: remove :cr external format (it's unused); the rest is
	already part of 6.2, so ignore it there

*******************************************************************************
1.0.14 release

1.0.14

	* README: tweaks
	* ftpd.cl: load config.cl at app build time
	* makefile: do away with binaries/, since it's not needed; add
	`src' rule

	* (NEW) makefile
	* (NEW) binaries/linux
	* (NEW) binaries/solaris

2002-08-09  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.0.13

	* ftpd.cl:  
	Inc'd the version number to 1.0.13.

	Added code to implement new *pasvipaddrs* parameter.

	* ipaddr.cl: 
	New file used to parse and match IP network addresses (needed for
	new *pasvipaddrs* parameter).

	* README:

2002-02-19  D Layer  <layer@relay.known.net>
1.0.12

	* README: reorganize and add a little more info
	* CONFIG, config.cl, ftpd.cl:
	renamed CONFIG to config.cl, and include it during the compilation
	of ftpd.cl

2002-02-14  Kevin Layer  <layer@crikey>
1.0.11

	* ftpd.cl: add version #

2002-01-21  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* CONFIG: Added RCS id tag.  Added pointer to Security notes
	section in README for conversions.

	* README: Added Security notes section.  Added additional info for
	anonymous FTP setup

	* ftpd.cl: Added pointer to Security notes section in README for
	conversions.  

2002-01-18  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* README: Fleshed out.

	* CONFIG: New file w/ configuration section of ftpd.cl for
	documentation purposes.

	* ftpd.cl:  Made the connection banner a configurable parameter.

	Added a gang of comments for the config params.

2002-01-07  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* ftpd.cl:
	Added parameter *pidsfile* which holds the path to the pids file.
	The pids file keeps track of ftpd's that may be running (for in
	limiting the number of connections).

	Changed the default control channel timeout to 5 minutes.

	Added kill() foreign call.

	Added some macros related to forking.

	Removed old child reaping code.  It didn't work out well.
	Children are now immediately orphaned so that they become children
	of process id #1 (init) (which always reaps).  

	New children call add-pid to add their process id to the
	*pidsfile* flie.  

	To check the connections limit, probe-pids-file is called.  This
	function calls kill w/ signal 0 for every pid it finds in the
	*pidsfile* file.  signal 0 doesn't actually send a signal, but
	does error checking.  This effectively checks for the existence of
	a particular processes.  The list of processes that still exist is
	written back to the *pidsfile* file and the count is returned.

	Made NLST use globbing.  Some clients expect this.

2001-12-20  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* ftpd.cl: fixed WNOHANG constant for Solaris.

	Changed calls to with-stream-lock (removed :wait keyword..  always
	want to wait).

	* posix-lock.cl:  Added with-saved-file-position macro which
	executes its body with file position set to 0 beforehand and
	restored afterword.    Now using this macro in the lock- and
	unlock-stream functions to ensure the the entire file is locked
	and unlocked.  

2001-12-19  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* ftpd.cl: Added make-active-connection function to make a
	PORT-based connection which will log errors.
	establish-data-connection uses this now.

	* ftpd.cl:
	Added *ftpdataport* parameter.  Defaults to 20 and will likely
	never be changed by anyone.

	Added *maxusers* parameter.  If set to a number, it indicates the
	maximum number of clients that can be connected at once.  

	Added *toomanymsg* parameter.  Defaults to /etc/toomany.msg which
	is a file that will be displayed when someone tries to use the
	PASS command when *maxusers* has been reached.

	Renamed *anonymous-???-restricted* to *anonymous-???-disabled*.

	Changed conversion list.  No need to call (vector) for vector
	literals.

	Added summore foreign calls for uid management.

	Added *extra-files* parameter which lists the other source files
	that go w/ this app.

	Program is now easy to kill with control-C in debug mode.

	Added code to keep track of how many children there are.

	Added parameter *reaptime* to control how often a check is done
	for an exited child.  Defaults to 10 seconds.  Set to a lower
	value if you want higher accuracy.

	strerror: If 'errno' is null, return "Unknown error".

	outline: Used Kevin's code for making sure that security problems
	don't creep in from programming mistakes using outline without a
	format string.

	Removed with-output-to-client macro.  It was only used in one
	place and wasn't necessary.

	stderr-reader: Logs to ftp log instead of standard output.

	get-request:  Maximum line length is now 5000 characters.
	Updated this function to gracefully deal with too-long lines.  The
	entire line is ignored and a line-too-long error is returned to
	the client.

	Added macro with-root-privs for doing certain operations that
	require root privs.  This should be checked for any potential
	issues.
	
	cmd-pass: Added maxusers check.   Changed call to setgid to
	setegid.  Changed call to setuid to seteuid.  Now we can recover
	root privs when necessary [and so can anyone who manages to find
	some exploit to execute arbitrary code].

	dump-msg:  New function to dump a file to the control connection,
	prefixed by a code.   dump-welcome-msg was removed and the call to
	it was replaced w/ a call to dump-msg.  The too-many-users file is
	displayed using this now as well.

	PORT-based FTP data connections now use the local port
	*ftpdataport* (default, 20).  Some clients required this.  Using
	port 20 requires root privs.

	Fixed several places where I used 't' as the general case in a
	handler-case, rather than 'error'.
		
	Removed compile-regexp from places that it wasn't necessary. jkf
	says that there's a compiler macro for regular expressions.

	make-mdtm-string:  No longer uses C library call.  All built in
	stuff w/ help from Charley.

	glob-single:  Shorter now due to use of enough-namestring.

	make-relative, basename: Unnecessary functions removed.

	ftp-log and xferlog:  Use posix locks to make sure that several
	clients don't smash updates to the logs.  Also, make sure writing
	always begins at the end of the log.  

	main: Make sure that ACL 6.1 or later is being used.  
	Added some command line arguments.  -d to run in debugging mode.
	-p xxxx to use an alternative FTP port.  -f xxx to specify an
	alternate config file.  

	top level:  Complain if trying to build on non-linux, non-Solaris
	platform.

	Moved process group setting stuff into its own function.

	getpwnam.cl: Renamed to passwd.cl

	posix-lock.cl: New

2001-12-11  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* ftpd.cl:  Removed dependency on stat.cl.  Changed stuff over to
	use excl::filesys- and other built-in stuff.  

	* stat.cl: Removed

	* ftpd.cl:  Make sure that the anonymous ftp account actually
	exists before allowing an anonymous login.

2001-12-10  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* Added *xferlog* parameter which specifies the location of the
	transfer log file.  Added code to do xferlog logging.  The log has
	the following format:

	(universal-time numeric-ip-address file direction bytes user)

	If *debug* is non-nill, the xferlog goes to stdout.	
	
2001-12-08  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* Enhanced the *restricted-users* stuff.  If it's 't' everyone is
	restricted except for those users listed in *unrestricted-users*.

	* Rewrote make-full-path since it was missing some situations.

	* The config file is now reloaded for each new connection so that
	changes can be made on the fly.

	* Added *logfile* and it's workings.  

	* Process forks and disassociates from the controlling terminal
	now.  More like a typical daemon.

2001-12-07  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* README: added build instructions and fixed a typo.

	* eol.cl:  Some export changes suggested by jkf.

	* ftp.cl:
	Added *restricted-users* variable.  Users in this list will be
	confined to their home directories.   Added code to handle this
	feature.  

	Changed conversions to use vectors instead of strings.  This is
	safer.

	store-file-ascii updated to use external format stuff.

	Turned off globbing support for STAT.

	Added :srecord to generate-executable call.
	
2001-12-06  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* Added support for the telnet codes that sometimes get sent
	before ABOR requests.  They're ignored.  Double-IAC codes are
	converted to a single #xff character (in case a filename has such
	a character).  

	* Added cmd-abor.  I thought I had that in there already.

	* Transfer error messages are now ensured to be all on one line.

	* Fixed bug in store-file-binary.  

	* added minimal HELP SITE support.
	
	* Updated the way the config file is loaded.  Add process id to
	ftp-log output.  If *debug* is :verbose, log (outline) data. 

	* eol.cl:  Added some 'require's.

	* ftpd.cl:  Changed the default PASV port range.  Changed *debug*
	to default to nil.  Added *configfile* parameter and code to load
	*configfile* if it exists. 

	Some external format changes.  Using a 6.1-only :e-crlf format
	which eased some application building pains.

	Added ftp-log function for logging.  Changed all relevant format
	statements to calls to ftp-log.

	Changed the "Entering Passive Mode" respond (removed some
	debugging info that upset Opera).

	Added "image" and "ascii" as aliases for "i" and "a" in the TYPE
	command [Bogus browsers.. *sigh*].
	
	Added application-building function.
