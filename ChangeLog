	* eol.cl:  Added some 'require's.

	* ftpd.cl:  Changed the default PASV port range.  Changed *debug*
	to default to nil.  Added *configfile* parameter and code to load
	*configfile* if it exists. 

	Some external format changes.  Using a 6.1-only :e-crlf format
	which eased some application building pains.

	Added ftp-log function for logging.  Changed all relevant format
	statements to calls to ftp-log.

	Changed the "Entering Passive Mode" respond (removed some
	debugging info that upset Opera).

	Added "image" and "ascii" as aliases for "i" and "a" in the TYPE
	command [Bogus browsers.. *sigh*].
	
	Added application-building function.
