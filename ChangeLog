	* Added *xferlog* parameter which specifies the location of the
	transfer log file.  Added code to do xferlog logging.  The log has
	the following format:

	(universal-time numeric-ip-address file direction bytes user)

	If *debug* is non-nill, the xferlog goes to stdout.

	* Enhanced the *restricted-users* stuff.  If it's 't' everyone is
	restricted except for those users listed in *unrestricted-users*.

	* Rewrote make-full-path since it was missing some situations.

	* The config file is now reloaded for each new connection so that
	changes can be made on the fly.

	* Added *logfile* and it's workings.  

	* Process forks and disassociates from the controlling terminal
	now.  More like a typical daemon.

	* README: added build instructions and fixed a typo.

	* eol.cl:  Some export changes suggested by jkf.

	* ftp.cl:
	Added *restricted-users* variable.  Users in this list will be
	confined to their home directories.   Added code to handle this
	feature.  

	Changed conversions to use vectors instead of strings.  This is
	safer.

	store-file-ascii updated to use external format stuff.

	Turned off globbing support for STAT.

	Added :srecord to generate-executable call.
	
2001-12-06  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* Added support for the telnet codes that sometimes get sent
	before ABOR requests.  They're ignored.  Double-IAC codes are
	converted to a single #xff character (in case a filename has such
	a character).  

	* Added cmd-abor.  I thought I had that in there already.

	* Transfer error messages are now ensured to be all on one line.

	* Fixed bug in store-file-binary.  

	* added minimal HELP SITE support.
	
	* Updated the way the config file is loaded.  Add process id to
	ftp-log output.  If *debug* is :verbose, log (outline) data. 

	* eol.cl:  Added some 'require's.

	* ftpd.cl:  Changed the default PASV port range.  Changed *debug*
	to default to nil.  Added *configfile* parameter and code to load
	*configfile* if it exists. 

	Some external format changes.  Using a 6.1-only :e-crlf format
	which eased some application building pains.

	Added ftp-log function for logging.  Changed all relevant format
	statements to calls to ftp-log.

	Changed the "Entering Passive Mode" respond (removed some
	debugging info that upset Opera).

	Added "image" and "ascii" as aliases for "i" and "a" in the TYPE
	command [Bogus browsers.. *sigh*].
	
	Added application-building function.
